1) Write a program to accepts two numbers from stdin and find all the odd as well as even numbers present in between them.
import java.util.Scanner;

import java.util.Scanner;
	public class acad 
	{ 
    public static void main(String args[])
	{
	Scanner s=new Scanner(System.in); 
	int a,b; 
	System.out.println("Enter the first number"); 
	a=s.nextInt(); //the user will give the first number
	System.out.println("Enter the second number:");
	b=s.nextInt(); //and now we are provided by second number from the user
	System.out.println("The even numbers are");
	for(int i=a;i<=b;i++)
	{
	if(i%2==0)//when divided by 2 and if the denominator is 0.then it is even.
	{
	System.out.println(i); 
	}
	System.out.println("The odd numbers are"); 
	for(i=a;i<=b;i++) 
	{ 
	if(i%2!=0) System.out.println(i);//when we divide the i value by 2 and if the denominator is not zero then it's odd.
	}
	} }}


We will get the first number from the user as well the second number.it will go inside the for loop.and will check whethere the given
number is divisible by 2 and the remainder is 0. if so the number will be "even". if the remainder is 1 then it will be a odd number.

2) Joe is scared to go to school. When her dad asked the reason, joe said she is unable to complete the task given by her teacher. 
The task was to find the “first 10 multiples” of the number entered from stdin



	import java.util.Scanner;

	public class acad 
	{ 
	public static void main(String args[]) 
	{ 
	Scanner s=new Scanner(System.in);
	int a;
	System.out.println("Enter the number"); 
	a=s.nextInt(); //userr will provide teh input number
	for(int i=1;i<=10;i++) //and the for loop will run 10 times.
	{
	System.out.println(a+" * "+i+" = "+(a*i)); //will print the output.
	}
	} }


the input will be obtained from the user.and in the next line it will go inside the loop. if the input for example is 2 will check until
the number becmes 10.a*i will multiply the (a=the given input) with the (i-loop numbers from 1 to 10).and will print the output.

3) Write a program consisting method sum() and demonstrate the concept of method overloading using this method.

import java.util.Scanner;
public class acad
{
public static void main(String args[])
{
Scanner s=new Scanner(System.in);
System.out.println("1.Sum of two numbers \n 2.Sum of three numbers");//it prints the output 
int a =s.nextInt();
switch (a)
{
case 1 : System.out.println("Enter two numbers");
int x=s.nextInt();
int y=s.nextInt(); 
sum(x,y); //here two numbers will be added up. 
break; 
case 2 : 
System.out.println("Enter three numbers");
int b=s.nextInt();
int c=s.nextInt(); 
int d=s.nextInt();
sum(b,c,d); //sum of three integers is done here
break;
}
}

public static void sum(int a,int b) //here two integers are given by the user.
{
System.out.println("Sum of two numbers are "+(a+b));//two integers are added up
}
public static void sum(int a,int b,int c) //here three integers are given by the user 
{ 
System.out.println("Sum of three numbers are "+(a+b+c)); //three integers are added up.
}
}


here switch case is used to check whethere to get two numbers or three numbers from the user. and if for example two numbers then we need
to enter those two numbers .and will get the number and sum those two numbers and print that in output.the same can be done for three numbers
to.
